## 🌐 Overview

The CannaForge Ecosystem is a unified, multi-framework architecture designed to bridge the gap between advanced cannabis cultivation and precision medicinal application. By utilizing the proprietary Forge & Decay model, this ecosystem provides a standardized language and toolset for both producers and patients.

This project serves as a central hub connecting three specialized frameworks:

- **CannaForge**: Advanced cultivation methodology.
- **Therapeutic Forge**: Clinical patient management and effect building.
- **Terp Forge**: Terpene profile optimization and volatile preservation.

## 🏗️ The Core Framework: Forge & Decay

The ecosystem operates on a continuous four-stage cycle that standardizes the journey from seed to therapeutic outcome:

1. **Cultivation Forge**: Structural building through optimized light, training, and nutrient protocols.
2. **Cultivation Decay**: Controlled senescence and metabolic ripening during the flowering phase.
3. **Therapeutic Forge**: Strategic building of therapeutic effects through cannabinoid synergy and bioavailability.
4. **Tolerance Decay**: Proactive management of receptor adaptation and metabolic resets.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Unified Theory**: Identical principles applied across both AgTech and HealthTech sectors.
- **Predictable Outcomes**: Leverages cultivation data to inform clinical patient expectations.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: A bidirectional flow where cultivation insights optimize medicinal delivery.
- **B2B Readiness**: Modular architecture designed for seamless integration into existing Patient Dashboards and EHR systems.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3 (Custom variables for phase-branding), JavaScript |
| **Visuals** | FontAwesome 6.4, Particles.js for high-engagement UI |
| **Mobile First** | Fully responsive design optimized for clinical and field use |

## 📄 Licensing

This ecosystem is licensed under the MIT License.

- **Permission**: Free use, modification, and sublicensing for both personal and commercial purposes.
- **Compliance**: Designed as a "low-friction" asset for rapid corporate adoption.

## 🤝 Clinical & Corporate Integration

The CannaForge Ecosystem is built to support the 2025 shift toward Precision Medicine. Our "Therapeutic Forge" and "Tolerance Decay" modules are specifically designed to enhance:

- **Patient Retention** (managing the "plateau" effect).
- **Health Literacy** (standardized educational terminology).
- **Real-World Evidence (RWE)** tracking.
